# Slime Slayer
*Slime Slayer* is a 2D top-down, endless fighter game. The objective is to survive for as long as possible from the slimes, which multiply and progressively get stronger as times goes on. There are several areas on the map, which must be opened up using points, that will aid the player in their quest to survive. *Slime Slayer* was developed in a 24-hour period during Purdue University's *Hello World Hackathon* in September 2022.

## Gameplay
The player spawns in a small, cramped area and soon become swarmed with slimes. Players can attack, and eventually kill, the slimes and gain points in the process. As the player navigates the spawn area, they will discover several keys which can be used to open chests, which will give the player a random powerup:
- `Health`: Players will gain a random amount of health points
- `Points`: Players will gain a random amount of points
- `Speed`: Players will gain a minor speed boost that lasts until the player's death

After accumulating `500` points, the user can open the gates of the spawn area and explore the rest of the map. Whenever a purchase is made, the player will lose the points they used to make the purchase, and will have to earn them back. Players will discover three other areas of the map that must be unlocked with `1000` more points. In the North-West corner of the map, there is a pen where players can purchase a cat, which vary in perks:
- `Green`: heals the player over time
- `Gold`: gives the player extra points over time
- `White`: slows down enemy slimes when they are attacked

In the North-East corner of the map is the library. Players can purchase an explosion weapon, which deals high damage to all slimes within a specified radius of the player. The explosion comes it its own effect provided by the *Mystic Woods* Texture Pack. In the South portion of the map, players can pack-a-punch their weapon for a price that increments after each purchase, to increase the damage of their weapon. The objective is to survive for as long as possible, and players can document their scores by reading the timer on their screen. There may also be a wonder weapon that players will have to discover.
