# Slime Slayer
*Slime Slayer* is a 2D top-down, endless fighter game. The objective is to survive for as long as possible from the slimes, which multiply and progressively get stronger as times goes on. There are several areas on the map, which must be opened up using points, that will aid the player in their quest to survive. *Slime Slayer* was developed in a 24-hour period during Purdue University's *Hello World Hackathon* in September 2022.
